# delete-prereleases-for-branch

This action will retrieve the list of releases for the repository and delete any releases and associated tags that:
- Are marked as pre-release (it won't delete full releases)
- Include a pre-release branch tag in the format generated by [im-open/git-version-lite] (`major.minor.patch-<sanitized-branch-name>.<formated-date>`) in the release name or the release's tag.  
  - To sanitize the branch name, the characters `a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and -` are kept and any other character is replaced with `-`.  
- Are returned in the [list releases] API call. Depending on the permissions of the token it may return only published releases (not draft releases).

If the action runs into an issue deleting a specific release, it will generate a warning that can be viewed in the Summary section of the workflow rather than failing.  Errors retrieving the releases will still cause the action to fail though.

## Contributing

When creating new PRs please ensure:
1. The action has been recompiled.  See the [Recompiling](#recompiling) section below for more details.
2. For major or minor changes, at least one of the commit messages contains the appropriate `+semver:` keywords listed under [Incrementing the Version](#incrementing-the-version).
3. The `README.md` example has been updated with the new version.  See [Incrementing the Version](#incrementing-the-version).
4. The action code does not contain sensitive information.

### Recompiling

If changes are made to the action's code in this repository, or its dependencies, you will need to re-compile the action.

```sh
# Installs dependencies and bundles the code
npm run build

# Bundle the code (if dependencies are already installed)
npm run bundle
```

These commands utilize [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/getting-started/#bundling-for-node) to bundle the action and
its dependencies into a single file located in the `dist` folder.

### Incrementing the Version

This action uses [git-version-lite] to examine commit messages to determine whether to perform a major, minor or patch increment on merge.  The following table provides the fragment that should be included in a commit message to active different increment strategies.
| Increment Type | Commit Message Fragment                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| major          | +semver:breaking                            |
| major          | +semver:major                               |
| minor          | +semver:feature                             |
| minor          | +semver:minor                               |
| patch          | *default increment type, no comment needed* |
